          <b>Premise:</b> Earlier in <a href="https://kardashev-research.github.io/drafts/img/diagram.png">this diagram</a> I envisioned how Type-I civilization would involve alignment of Humanity and Machinity. Thinking about the next (third) subject to pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research, I came upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HiADisBfQ0">this video</a> which rekindled my interests in Plant Physiology. Considering the diagram, I am classifying the concepts of Plant Physiology under Biology; since plants are forms of life resulting from natural intelligence acting upon matter. Most attention in AI research is confined within humanity (neuroscience, animal behavior, etc.). Understanding Plant Physiology can help develop an botanical AI system where plants cooperate in nutrient-scarce ecosystem. During this study I am also designing (link to draft [to be added soon]) and prototyping (link to demo [to be added soon]) a system in a model garden.

          <b>Premise:</b> Earlier in <a href="https://kardashev-research.github.io/drafts/img/diagram.png">this diagram</a> I envisioned how Type-I civilization would involve alignment of Humanity and Machinity. Thinking about the next (fourth) subject to pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research, I came upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HiADisBfQ0">this video</a> which rekindled my interests in Plant Physiology (PtPy). Considering the diagram, I am classifying this interest in PtPy under Biology; since plants are forms of life resulting from natural intelligence acting upon matter. This study would help me be knowledgeable when I go deeper in following research in AI-botany crossover. I think of AI systems which may help plants cooperate (instead of compete) in nutrient-scarce ecosystem and also undergo laminar growth (in context of aging).

        <h1>Sociology</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Premise:</b> I believe that a major impediment in our progress is our dissatisfaction and cynicism about almost everything. Therefore, the first subject I pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research is Sociology.
        </p>
        <h2>Social progress</h2>
        <p>
          A contemporary of the Age of Enlightenment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ferguson">Adam Ferguson (1723-1816)</a> felt that commercial growth was happening at the expense of traditional values of cooperation. More people nowadays demand change through competition rather than seeking order through cooperation. During the Industrial Revolution, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)</a> identified that economic inequality arises as materials and/or means of their production are privately held. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx (1818-1883)</a> identified four historical epochs: early human society would have been classless with primitive communism, then slavery divided ancient society in masters and slaves, feudalism divided society in aristocratic elite and peasants, and capitalism divides society in bourgeoisie (owners) and proletariat (workers). Marx believed social progress is about resolving the class conflict due to economic exploitation: owners are enriched while workers remain poor. Industrialization, which preceded capitalism, was a product of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution">Scientific Revolution (16th and 17th centuries)</a> that brought about radical changes to what constituted sound knowledge in the 18th century. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries)</a>, progress was understood in economic terms of industrial productivity and scientific discovery, a perspective that is somewhat popular even today. Witnessing the birth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte">Auguste Comte (1798–1857)</a> challenged this perspective with the proposition that valid knowledge of anything (even progress) can only be derived through scientific inquiry. <i>Sociology</i> was developed to distinguish social progress from technological progress (which comes about through <i>Technology</i>). With On the Origin of Species by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin (1809-1882)</a> evolution was introduced, a biological progress (which comes about through <i>Biology</i>). It provoked a radical rethinking of what progress means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Herbert Spencer (1820-1903)</a> portrayed society as an evolving organism with interrelated parts serving different complementary functions, which inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim">Émile Durkheim (1858-1917)</a> to identify interdependence in division of labor as the basis of solidarity in industrial society, as opposed to collective consciousness in primitive society. Religion and culture used to create a collective consciousness that provided solidarity to communities in primitive society. With industrialization, society is evolving to become a complex organism with continuous sophistication through division and specialization of labor. Interdependence of individuals is the basis of cohesion in modern society (Gesellschaft). Collective consciousness (Wesenwille) diminishes as people differentiate during their rationalized pursuits (Kürwille). Yet, it continues to subconsciously motivate formation and preservation of small social groupings (Gemeinschafts) marked by community spirit.
        </p>
        <h2>Will of individual</h2>
        <p>
          Following the Industrial Revolution, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber">Max Weber (1864–1920)</a> noted that the machine-like effectiveness and efficiency demanded in rationalized pursuits made bureaucratization of social administration (rigid legal rules, specialization and hierarchy) inevitable. It led to dehumanization of individuals in the bureaucratic middle class as cogs in machines. Because the primary goal of rationalization is to get things done efficiently, the desires of the individual are subservient to the goals of the bureaucracy, leading to a loss of individual autonomy. Individuals then struggle to acquire a better job (status), more money (wealth), or more prestige (power), as their creativity is valued less than their productivity. The erosion of spiritual values (Wesenwille) means their social actions are instead based on calculations of cost and benefit (Kürwille), and they become a matter more of administration (as workers) than moral or social guidance (as students). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills">Charles Wright Mills (1916–1962)</a> noted that mass society was unaware of the way in which their lives are affected by concentration of political and social power in the power elite. Individuals continued to perceive their troubles, such as becoming unemployed, or ending up homeless or in debt, as personal failures and not in terms of forces of historical change. This is due to the lack of sociological imagination in the mass society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lefebvre">Henri Lefebvre (1901-1991)</a> encouraged social spaces for all people to meet on an equal footing despite the power relationships across their diverse identities, and a hope for all classes to participate in rebuilding of cities that celebrate creativity from diverse ways of being. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs (1916–2006)</a> encouraged diversity at the sidewalks instead of segregation of commercial, business and residential areas as sidewalk encounters can help individuals in becoming acquainted with their neighbors and neighborhood. Such interactions could broaden awareness of individuals and lead to mass sociological imagination.
        </p>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Until the mid-20th century, much of Sociology believed people’s behavior could be predicted by finding the underlying rules of society, but the dynamics had changed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Garfinkel">Harold Garfinkel (1917–2011)</a> observed that the ‘underlying’ rules of macroscopic social change and order were instead built from the everyday microscopic actions of people in different situations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault">Michel Foucault (1926–1984)</a> explained power relations as the major force of social order. For example, institutions such as prisons, asylums, hospitals, schools, and police exercise disciplinary power: specifically, monitoring and acting to prevent people from behaving in certain ways; characterizing a pervasive sort of power than the notion of mere occasions of public punishment in feudal society. Power is therefore not something someone has, like a weapon, but something that is done to others, an action that affects the action of others. Punitive sovereign power is dismissed, or at least resisted, in modern society as inhuman, while pervasive disciplinary power brings about control as individuals tend to regulate their microscopic behaviors according to norms shaped in the situations of a prison cell, a classroom, or a traffic junction. Discourse, and not revolution, is the instrument of power relations and their resistance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998)</a> observed that societal systems - the economic, educational, scientific, legal, political, religious, and so on -  consist of communications, and not people (who shall be understood as mere enactors of communications). Drawing from the autopoiesis (pronounced "auto-poy-E-sis") perspective in <i>Biology</i> and laws of form perspective in <i>Mathematics</i>, he remarked on operational closedness of communications and the lack of integration in systems by design. This highlights the importance of structural couplings - certain entities that help to connect separated systems by translating the communications produced by one system into terms that the other can understand. With The Information Age: Volume I: The Rise of the Network Society (1996), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells">Manuel Castells (1942-)</a> describes the emergence of network society in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age (mid-20th century-)</a> as systems for exchange of information and knowledge, adding new forms of communications aside industrial society (which comprises systems for trade of goods and services). In network society, data and networking are at the heart of competitiveness and productivity.
        </p>
        <h2>Cultural progress</h2>
        <p>
          With The Metropolis and Mental Life, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Simmel">Georg Simmel (1858-1918)</a> explained how in urban society an individual was largely unknown to those who surrounded them, unlike rural society where individuals would be intimately familiar with those around them. The rapid tempo of life in a city demanded people to develop a ‘blasé attitude’ insulating them from excess stimuli; a mechanism to cope with the mental disturbance created by immersion in city life. For example, minimizing social interaction in public by avoiding eye contact. With The McDonaldization of Society (1993), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ritzer">George Ritzer (1940-)</a> remarked on components of extreme rationalization in 21st century businesses: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Efficiency is marked by predesigned processes that lead to specified ends. Calculability is marked by quantification and the proposition that bigger the better i.e. more quantity is more quality. Predictability is marked by providing consistent service across locations and times. Control is marked by use of technology for seamless operation and management of above components. These components have become the dominant cultural template for high competitiveness in several consumer industries worldwide. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Robertson">Roland Robertson (1938-2022)</a> emphasized that the emergence of such globalizing forces does not mean the world is moving toward a single global culture. Rather, local cultures adopt and redefine any global cultural product to suit their particular needs, beliefs, and customs. For example, while Hollywood movies inspired Indian film-makers in the development of Bollywood, the art forms produced are distinct and appeal to local culture. Allowances for local contingencies and contexts (e.g. including of vegetarian burgers on McDonald’s menus in India) lead to glocalization: global forms are modified upon contact with local communities and individuals. With The Disneyization of Society (2004), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bryman">Alan Bryman (1947–2017)</a> remarked on the blurring of reality and fantasy by fake transformation of everyday activities into extraordinary experiences. He identified four aspects to Disneyization: theming, hybrid consumption, merchandising, and emotional labor. Theming is the application of cultural interests to make an establishment or object popular, e.g. rainforest theme in a cafe. Hybrid consumption refers to interlinking of different kinds of consumptions, e.g. shopping malls in airports. Merchandising is promotion and sale of unrelated goods or services with copyrighted images and logos, e.g. coffee mugs with a university’s logo. Emotional labor involves scripted interactions and dress-ups to enact performances for endless entertainment, e.g. commodification of private emotions in a motion picture. The transformation of everyday occurrences, such as shopping and eating, into spectacular and sensational events by such processes undermines the authenticity of experiences in traditional places. Together McDonaldization and Disneyization describe cultural progress of high quantity modes of consumption and high quality modes of experiences for the rational individual.

        <h2>Identity creation</h2>
        <p>
          Solid modernity came about in the 20th century characterized by a maturing industrial and capitalist society. Defining features of solid modernity, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Bauman">Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017)</a>, is the organization of human activity and institutions along bureaucratic lines, where people live with a relatively stable set of norms, traditions and institutions, and social change is relatively ordered and predictable. He regarded solid modernity as realization of the Enlightenment view that reason leads to the emancipation of humankind. The social and political institutions of solid modernity addressed primarily national issues and problems. In the early 21st century, compulsive, obsessive, and addictive reinventing of the world, according to Bauman, has resulted in liquid modernity characterized by risk and unpredictability. Whereas solid modernity came about for streamlining production, liquid modernity came about for rapid and relentless consumption. Individuals nowadays self-create their identity through consumption, as traditional sources of identity, such as employment status and family ties, have withered under liquid modernity. But fluid identities come with a psychologically costly cycle of endless self-questioning and introspection resulting in anxiety and unease about who we are in a rapidly transforming world. Besides the unpredictability in individuals' life experience, liquid modernity presents increased level of global risk. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_Beck">Ulrich Beck (1944–2015)</a>, denial, apathy or transformation are the three social responses to global risk. Denial is behaving as if the risks do not exist or are small, e.g. climate change denial. Apathy is acknowledgement of risk but not doing something about it. Transformation is taking collective positive action under the shadow of risk, e.g. cosmopolitanism. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Giddens">Anthony Giddens (1938-)</a> explains anthropogenic climate change as a result of people’s tendency to choose a small reward now (fast food), rather than take a course of action (regular exercise) that might lead to a greater reward in the future (health). People don’t want to accept that their consumer lifestyles contribute to carbon emissions; fancier products that became central to their personal identity came from mining and refining more minerals. However, Giddens is optimistic that human ingenuity would result in cleaner sources of energy and carbon trading schemes and carbon taxes would cap the emissions.

        <h2>Imagination</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead">George Mead (1863-1931)</a> observed that behaviors, expectations, and attitudes we learn through interactions with others builds the social self. He distinguished the social self as ‘me’ from the psychological self, the ‘I’. While Mead found an interactionist social self in the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)">Stuart Hall (1932–2014)</a> found a self detached from learning by interaction, but rather formed and transformed with a mashup of global culture. With Culture is Ordinary (1958), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams">Raymond Williams (1921–1988)</a> offered a perspective from his personal experiences that it is not the ideologies or institutions, but rather ordinary life experiences in the community that comprise the culture. Such externalized existence of culture from society was further expressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_C._Alexander">Jeffrey Alexander (1947-)</a> who argues that culture behaves like software in a computing cloud, distant but very real. Users contribute to and draw upon it to create meaning in the world. As technology brought automation, workers began feeling alienated from and lack of control over their work in the society. Culture has become an escape to belongingness and control over life. In the 21st century, when the world is almost fully connected through the Internet and supply chains, identity creation from the global culture is only limited by imagination. Some believe we are entering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_age">Imagination Age</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
          For much of human history, society had been a collection of families and communities, and the community spirit was fostered by ideas of honor, service and loyalty. The shift towards personal identity building in recent centuries weakens our values, and we are ultimately leading to social collapse where we may lose belongingness with communities or even our families. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitai_Etzioni">Amitai Etzioni (1929-)</a> suggests communitarianism aspect of families: parents have a moral responsibility to the community to raise their children to the best of their ability; and the communities have an obligation to help them in their efforts. On gender roles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead">Margaret Mead (1901-1978)</a> emphasized that the expectations were a result of cultural conditioning and not determined human behaviors. In New Guinea, she found Arapesh tribal men and women both were gentle, responsive, and cooperative and both undertook childcare, traits the West would see as feminine. While Mundugumor women behaved in a masculine way by being as violent and aggressive as the men when needed. And women in Tchambuli society were dominant, while men were seen as dependent. Her ideas pose a fundamental challenge to rigid understandings of gender roles across societies. Since children learn their gender roles from their parents, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talcott_Parsons">Talcott Parsons (1902-1979)</a> believed families are factories that produce human personalities, and not the society as much. He proposed a neat division of the mother’s role in cultural training (being maker of household happiness) and father’s role in societal training (being leader of breadwinning). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlie_Russell_Hochschild">Arlie Hochschild (1940-)</a> notes childhood training of the heart: whereas girls learn to be caring and master aggression and anger, boys learn to mask fear and vulnerability. Based on her Marxist-style investigation of material benefits accruing to the parties, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Delphy">Christine Delphy (1941-)</a> claims marriage, meaning legal partnership, benefits the man when the home environment becomes patriarchal. She pointed out that a wife’s obligation to perform domestic duties may become institutionalized on entering marriage, making marriage a labor contract. Yet, as Mead points out, gender roles differ across societies and patriarchy may not prevail in every marriage. Willing performance of gender-appropriate roles by adults, does help stabilize society as it influences children’s personalities towards social norms. Husband-and-wife team Ulrich Beck and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Beck-Gernsheim">Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim</a> highlight the importance of children in leveling the field: while love between adults might be viewed as temporary and vulnerable in conflict of gender roles and in pursuit of individual self-actualization, love for children, with both parents investing emotionally in their children, can be seen as providing unconditional love.

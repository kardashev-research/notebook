        <h1>Astronomy</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Premise:</b> After studying a bit of Sociology and Phiolosophy (in context of Humanity and Ideas), the third subject I am picking up for our studies at Kardashev Research is Astronomy (in context of Observable Universe).

        <h2>Celestial interests</h2>
        <p>
          Many of us are barely aware of the night sky as light pollution in cities overwhelms the delicate light from stars. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Following_the_Milky_Way_over_ALMA.webm">magnificient sweep of the Milky Way</a> can be observed arching over ALMA in Chile. Study of Astronomy used to be an important cultural activity around the world as evidenced by Archaeoastronomy. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2679675.stm">oldest image of constellation of Orion</a> was recognised on a tablet made of mammoth tusk found in Germany dated back to ~30000 BC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_tablet_of_Ammisaduqa"> Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa</a>, dated back to ~1650 BC, is perhaps the oldest record of motion of Venus. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">oldest computer (Antikythera mechanism)</a> found in Greece dates back to ~150 BC and was tasked to predict eclipses. As early cultures, such as the Babylonians of Mesopotamia, identified celestial phenomena with gods and spirits, Astronomy's most important application was in Astrology. With charting of connections between the celestial and the terrestrial began the practice of interpreting horoscopes around 6th century BC. By the mid 17th century, however, Astronomy began diverging from traditional Astrology as a scientific activity and with more technical uses such as timekeeping and navigation. Up to the 19th century, Astronomy stayed limited to charting the positions and movements of heavenly bodies. Since 20th century, with the introduction of atomic clocks and artificial satellites taking over these tasks, Astronomy has now moved on to more fantastic investigations, e.g. cosmology and astrobiology. We would never understand gravity the way Einstein imagined if it weren't for cosmology (dedicated astronomical equipment that recorded data from the sky (gravitational lensing) and space itself (gravitational waves)). We have lot of work to do in several fronts in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age">Space Age (mid-20th century to Today)</a>, but especially in astrobiology to extend life beyond Earth.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth (~4.54 billion years BC to Today)</a> is an actively transforming planet. Heat generated by nuclear reactions deep below the surface create tremors that keep reshaping the Earth's surface over time. Meanwhile, solar energy striking the planet creates currents in the atmosphere driving the weather, and lunar phases create tides in the ocean. The tilt of Earth causes seasons. Warm moist air rises from jungles such as rainforests in Borneo (near equator) and cool dry air descends into deserts such as Sahara (near tropic of cancer) and Atacama (near tropic of capricon). Observing Earth's shadow on the moon, Aristotle deduced that Earth is spherical. While this inference holds today, another of his deduction that shooting stars are eruptions from volcanoes doesn't hold; highlighting how the best minds can be deluded by their perspective or limitations of data available. Another example is the brilliant mathematician and inventor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Heng">Zhang Heng (78-139 AD)</a> who, besides helping us recognize that the Moon's brightness is actually reflected from Sun, had us entertain the idea that the universe was like an egg "as round as a crossbow pellet" with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk. Anyways, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos">Aristarchus (310-230 BC)</a>, as recorded by Archimedes, was first to hypothesize that "the fixed stars and Sun remain unmoved" and "Earth revolves about the Sun.". It was not until 15th century when the heliocentric model was revived by Copernicus. The "fixed stars" hypothesis was debunked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus">Hipparchus (190-120 BC)</a> who noticed a 2 degree east shift of Spica since 150 years ago (thanks to Astrology he had the astronomical data from so long ago) and discovered "precession of the equinoxes". This too was explained later by Copernicus. With Almagest, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy (100-170 AD)</a> published a compendium of astronomical data which would serve Astronomy for more than a thousand years. He also published Tetrabiblos which, by providing astrological interpretations from Almagest, helped Almagest find relevance and utility at the time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatta">Aryabhatta (476-550 AD)</a> supported findings of Hipparchus and also compiled a compendium of astronomical data which greatly helped Arabic astronomy.

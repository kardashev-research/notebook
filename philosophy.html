        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Premise:</b> Reasoning is a core human process. Therefore, the second subject I pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research is Philosophy. Today, the misconception that philosophy is unproductive overthinking on obscure concepts is due to its neat separation from science in curriculums of teaching. Given that amidst religon and folklore early philosophy was concerned with questions like "What is the universe made of?" (<i>Chemistry</i>) and "What is the nature of reality?" (<i>Physics</i>), it is <i>Philosophy</i> actually that made scientists capable of discovery, and in broader sense makes the public curious, reasoning and wise. Understanding and practicing philosophy is what enables us to search, create and refine ideas.

        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Thales of Miletus (around 624-548 BC)</a> was first to break from his civilization's explanation of objects and events as being due to the whims of gods. He instead offered naturalistic theories and hypotheses. Legend has it that while others prayed to gods for good harvest, Thales, by deducing that weather conditions, not appeals to the gods, led to a good harvest, achieved riches by buying up all the local olive presses just before high yield and renting them out in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras">Protagoras (490-420 BC)</a> was openly sophist, amassing considerable riches and fame by offering himself as an advisor (for people pleading their case in court) and teacher (claiming to teach euboulia i.e. excellence in counsel or sound judgement). His book titled Truth opened with the provocative sentence "Of all things the measure is man: of those that are, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are not", conveying to the effect that truth depends on perspective of the speaker, for one who calls an apple tasteless would be true in his own right as one who calls it tasty. A broader implication of this idea can be seen in Mathematics where the unit system tackles the broader notion that "everything is relative". In many matters therefore, reasoning would leads to construction of objectivity that one likens, due to the subjective nature of such matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to what Protagoras would have us believe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates (470-399 BC)</a> came up with a dialectical method where a less personal form of truth can result from a dialogue between parties which may hold opposing views, but hold common intention of learning. He wrote nothing and held no ideas as his own. The method earned him many enemies in Athens, where he lived, was vilified as a sophist (imagine that!) and was sentenced to death on charges of corrupting the young with ideas that undermined tradition. Today, his method is a cornerstone in Western philosophy. The Socratic method is a process of questioning, from a noob standpoint, the meaning of essential concepts that one uses every day but have never really thought about, thereby revealing our ignorance. His method of discovering the 'right', when applied in a discourse with an individual, also discovers what is 'wrong' with their beliefs. In his search for areté (virtue) he concluded that morality demands us to continuously 'examine' ourselves, for knowledge is the root of good, and ignorance that of evil. When Socrates said "the unexamined life is not worth living", he meant to not let any day pass without deep discussions with friends about goodness in all that happened and was done, rather than the accumulation of wealth and higher status. His proposition, I infer, is that we shall create personal identity not with consumer products, but with knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
          While Thales realized interaction of worldly processes as alternative causal explanations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagorus (570-495 BC)</a> realized mathematics as alternative language for universal forms and ideas. Whereas Egyptians had only discovered that a triangle whose sides have ratios of 3:4:5 always has a right angle (for its practical use), Pythagoras' 'revelation' that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides in all right-angled triangles had him held by Pythagoreans as a virtual messiah. He held his belief that the form of cosmos must be goverened by mathematical rules in addition (not in opposition) to the Milesian ideas on the substance of cosmos. In present day we easily accept geometry and atomism, two radically different perceptions of the content of the universe, without raising a finger. Pythagoras' ideas of harmonic relationships were uncanny, but they lead to the Law of Octaves in music and Chemistry. The principle of deductive reasoning can be traced to Pythagoras' perspective that 2 comes from 1+1. A mere expression of his fascination with numbers, which was later refined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid (around 300 BC)</a> forming basis of much of mathematical thinking. Pythagoras' idea that abstract thinking is superior to the evidence of the senses was a haughty proposition but has proved necessary to cause one to search for a higher ground to understand the world from. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides">Parmenides (around 500 BC)</a> deduced, in a Pythagorean way of abstract thinking, that something cannot come from nothing, a precursor to the modern law of conservation of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
          In theory of Forms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato (around 428-347 BC)</a> later refined Pythagoras' thesis about forms of cosmos, a pursuit in abstraction beyond sense-experience. According to Plato, reasoning is the process through which we can be able to perceive ideal forms (e.g. a circle) in the world of Ideas, of which everything we observe is an imperfect form (e.g. the sun) in the material (sensed) world. Employing abstraction, Plato argues that there exists an Idea of justice, which is true justice, and all the instances of justice in the material world around us are lesser variants of it. Through reasoning our goal should be to seek that ideal form. Plato believes this is possible by all of us: our body exists in the material world and able to perceive the forms in it through senses, while our mind can perceive ideal forms in it through reason. Plato imagines that our soul, which is immortal and eternal, must have inhabited the world of Ideas before our birth and yearns to return to that realm after our death. Learning then is only recollection of memories of the ideal forms, long familiar to our soul. Plato founded a school named Academy (from which "academic" is derived).

        <h2>Harmony</h2>
        <p>
          With Daode jing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Laozi (around 600-300 BC)</a> layed down a path for morality and ethics in Eastern Philosophy. He explained that the changes of the world are expression of dao (the Way) which lead to thousands of manifestations that make the world such as sunrise, aging, frustration, rain, etc. It is because of our desire and free will, we can stray from the dao, and disturb the world’s harmonious balance. By living in harmony with dao, we may lead a life of de (virtue). What dao is can't be expressed. But dao can be achieved through wu wei (non-reaction). It is the act of thoughtfulness, harmonious existence, simplicity, and solitary meditation that can champion one over the impulsivity, desires, ambition and overexploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Siddhartha Gautama (563-483 BC)</a> found that emotional suffering came from attachment to the self. He believed that a "middle way", between fun (self-indulgence) and disciple (self-denial), leads one to true happiness which he could not reach with sole practice of either. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne">Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592)</a> found emotional enslavement came from another kind of attachment: mass approval. He believed that solitude can help us attain approval from within.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius (551-479 BC)</a> proposed that the de (virtue) in relationships are that of benevolence (ren; encompassing seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness) and loyality (encompassing zhong, xiao, and li). For example, father should be loving while the child obedient, husband/wife should be fair and the wife/husband understanding, elder sibling should be gentle and the younger sibling respectful. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi">Mozi (470-391 BC)</a>, disliking the superior-inferior model of relationships, made a counter proposal that relationships should be equalized by reprocity and it can be achieved by belief of jian ai (universal love).
        </p>
        <h2>Faith</h2>
        <p>
          With Plato's philosophy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Saint Augustine (354-430)</a> of Christian faith, addressed the question: 'If God is entirely good and all-powerful, why is there evil in the world?'. His argument goes like this: We observe that human beings are rational. Now in order to be rational, humans must have free will. This means they must be able to choose between good or evil. Humans therefore choose to act badly or well. In conclusion, God is not the parent of evils. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna">Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980-1037)</a> of Islamic faith, devised a method of 'striping away any knowledge that can possibly be disproved, so we are left only with absolute truths', remarkably anticipating Descartes' method, and concluded, like him, that the mind is distinct from the body. The crux of his 'Flying Man' argument is simple: If I were blindfolded and suspended without touching anything, I wouldn't know that I have a body but would know that I, my self or the soul, exists. In conclusion, my mind and body are different. Some philosophers reject mind-body dualism, largely because of the scientific knowledge that thoughts can be attributed to signals through neural networks in the brain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes">Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126-1198)</a> of Islamic faith, proposed that philosophy and religion wouldn't be incompatible if we choose to 'interpret' as poetic expressions, rather than be oblidged to accept, such portions of religios texts that we can prove to be false based on our philosophical understanding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides) (1138-1204)</a> of Judaic faith, deduced from absence of both definable characteristics (gray hair, yellow skin, etc.) and accidental states (sitting, singing, etc.) that God has no physical attributes at all. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī (Rumi) (1207-1273)</a> of Sufic/Islamic faith, believed that understanding of divine-human relationship comes from activity (prayer, music, singing, and dancing) rather than from philosophy (e.g. rational analysis of a religious text for divine guidance). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa">Nikolaus von Kues (1401-1464)</a> of Christian faith, believed that God can be as incomprehensible as we can make them and we can still comprehend the incomprehensible God. For example, if we state that God come before everything, stertching it so far to say they come even before the possibility of existence of anything, then, because it is imcomprehensible that something comes to existence before its possibility arises, God is incomprehensible. It would seem then that the statement "The incomprehensible God does exist without possibility of existence" has no contradiction. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus">Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536)</a> of Christian faith, chose Concedo Nulli (Latin for 'I concede to no one') as a personal motto. He proposed that through folly (naive ignorance), individuals may form a personal relationship with God instead of being taught by certain religious doctrine. For example, one may 'interpret' religious texts as Ibn Rushd's followers, establish divine relationship through prayer and dance as Rumi's followers, hold God incomprehensible like Nikolaus von Kues, or with Socratic method expose the ignorance in any one of us who claims their faith is with good reason.

        <h2>Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          In contrast to what Plato has us believe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle (384–322 BC)</a>, a student of Plato at his Academy, proposed that ideal forms are generalized forms learnt from observation of varied forms in the material world. Although he came up with this counter proposal from his wildlife studies, and did not, in a clear way, refute Plato's proposition, it led to the division of epistemology camp into rationalists (knowledge from within) and empiricists (knowledge from outside). To prove his point, Aristotle set out to collect specimens of flora and fauna, and devised a hierarchical system so elegant in construction that it still forms the basis of modern taxonomy. With demonstration of human-level classification in computer vision, it becomes apparent that ideal forms may indeed be learnt from observation; still it doesn't disprove Plato's proposition. Aristotle, realizing observation as the source of truth about an object, came up with a causal system of an object's characteristics: material cause (what is it made of?), formal cause (how is it arranged?), efficient cause (how was it brought into being?), and final cause (what is its purpose?). It is easy to see that they are segregation of <i>Chemistry</i>, <i>Physics</i>, <i>Biology</i>, and Teleology (branch of <i>Philosophy</i>) for systematic study. Aristotle also came up with syllogism, the first formal system of logic ever devised. With Organon, Aristotle's notes on syllogistic system of logic became the standard text on logic and remained so until the emergence of mathematical logic as late as in the 19th century. With Novum Organum (i.e. a new Organon), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon (1561-1626)</a> proposed a new system of logic that he found more capable of producing knowledge than syllogism and natural laws. As opposed to syllogism, which had become a tool for demonstration by disputation, he proposed empiricism, a tool for learning by observation. He rejected the practice of inventing immutable natural laws in <i>anticipatio naturae</i> (anticipation of nature). Instead, he proposed <i>interpretatio naturae</i> (interpretation of nature) whereby new observations, especially those that can refute prior theory, are welcomed. To pull this off, he suggests to presuppose hypothesis on basis of current observations (induction), then collecting new observations for both proof and disproof of the hypothesis. Bacon's method of empiricism was a highly influential 'scientific method' of his time and was practiced through much of the Scientific Revolution.

          In setting out structure and sovereign governance of society with Leviathan, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)</a> presumed human beings to be no more than a machine of flesh and blood in which spirits carried information around to carry out operations. Such mechanistic perspective was aided by a detailed account of human circulatory system by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey">William Harvey (1578-1657)</a> with De Motu Cordis.
        </p>
        <h2>Doubt</h2>
        <p>
          Towards the pursuit of knowledge, while Socrates' method starts by inducing doubt in another mind, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes">René Descartes (1596-1650)</a> developed a method that starts by inducing doubt in our own mind. In striking contrast to how God and their creativity had been employed by many in describing ideas, he imagined an powerful and evil demon, Devil themself if you will, was deceiving him about almost everything. Indeed, senses can easily be deceived e.g. optical illusion. If so, perhaps his thoughts, even those of mathematical axioms, could be deceived too. However, he stumbled upon the thought of "I am, I exist.", which he calls first certainty. Say I have been deceived by this thought in believing that I exist. So I do not actually exist. Am I thinking without existing then? This point, as noted by Descartes as well, is where one helplessly tumbles into a universal doubt ("Perhaps, I don't exist!") that breaks certainty. Just like Archimedes found that with nothing but ONE firm and immovable point, and his sufficiently capable human body, he could have a hoothold and force to shift great masses, like the Earth, Descartes believed that with nothing but ONE certainty (his existence is self evident with his thinking), and his sufficiently capable human mind, he could have a foothold to reason through the helpless tumbling. Descartes confirmed that unlike the great promise of Archimedes' immovable point, the foothold/belief in first certainty did not serve him any more than helping him escape the universal doubt. The 'I' in it however lead to a debate on whether his certainty holds true if thoughts just floated around people's mind. Then, 'I' could be a unified consciousness doing the thinking and a thinker would actually not exist. That is, the thought could be occuring without Descartes existing. Descartes' defense was that if thoughts were not done individually by thinkers, reasoning wouldn't be possible. Consider syllogism: It is only when an individual believes A and B are true that they can conclude C from it. If two individuals separately believed in A and B, C can't be concluded (if a judge concludes C, they would have done so by believing in A and B first otherwise it would be taking the individual's word for it, which is irrational). So, the 'I' in the first certainty is the thinking individual. Apart from the first certainty, Descartes' another philosophical legacy were his deep thoughts on dualism i.e. mind-body distinction. Nevertheless, his most important legacy in practice is the method of doubting anything which is not yet self evident to the thinking individual.

        <h2>Will</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)</a> posited that human beings wager their lives that God exists or doesn't exist. This occurs due to the choice between will (They consider "I believe God exists." for the potential prize of happiness in Heaven) vs intellect (They consider "I have no reason to believe God exists." for the potential prize of an independent life in the world). From Nikolaus von Kues' proposition of incomprehensibility of God (existence without posibility of existense), it does seem we are left free to exercise will over intellect on this one. That intellect can't find no reason, is a reason enough to choose will.

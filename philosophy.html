        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Premise:</b> Reasoning is a core human process and has been at the heart of Scientific Revolution, Age of Enlightenment, and Industrial Revolution. Therefore, the second subject I pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research is Philosophy.

        <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>
          A popular misconception is that philosophical ideas come from philosophers thinking critically in isolation (i.e. are one man's opinion), but this is actually seldom the case. New ideas emerge not from individuals, but from debates and dialogues pursuing examination, analysis, and criticism of rudimentary ideas of individuals. Socrates didn’t even write his ideas. He merely questioned the assumptions of other people to gain deeper understanding and elicit fundamental truths. The writing of these conversations by Plato, his disciple, is how we learn of ideas that formed in those debates and dialogues. Indeed, original ideas published by a philosopher are seldom wholeheartedly accepted, rather they are met with criticism and challenge. The story of philosophy, and its practice, is that of seeking explanations that would satisfy our curiosity. Today, the misconception that philosophy is unproductive overthinking on obscure concepts is due to its separation from science in curriculums. Given that amidst religon and folklore early philosophy was concerned with questions like "What is the universe made of?" (<i>Chemistry</i>) and "What is the nature of reality?" (<i>Physics</i>), it is <i>Philosophy</i> actually that made scientists capable of discovery, and in broader sense makes the public curious, reasoning and wise. Understanding and practicing philosophy is what enables us to search, create and refine ideas.

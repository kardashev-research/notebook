        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Premise:</b> Reasoning is a core human process. Therefore, the second subject I pick up for our studies at Kardashev Research is Philosophy.
        </p>
        <h2>Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>
          A popular misconception is that philosophical ideas come from philosophers thinking critically in isolation (i.e. the ideas are one man's opinion), but this is actually seldom the case. New ideas emerge not from individuals, but from debates and dialogues pursuing examination, analysis, and criticism of rudimentary ideas of individuals. Socrates didn’t even write his ideas. He merely questioned the assumptions of other people to gain deeper understanding and elicit fundamental truths. The writing of these conversations by Plato, his disciple, is how we learn of ideas that formed in those debates and dialogues. Indeed, original ideas published by a philosopher are seldom wholeheartedly accepted, rather they are met with criticism and challenge. The story of philosophy, and its practice, is that of seeking explanations that would satisfy our curiosity. Today, the misconception that philosophy is unproductive overthinking on obscure concepts is due to its separation from science in curriculums. Given that amidst religon and folklore early philosophy was concerned with questions like "What is the universe made of?" (<i>Chemistry</i>) and "What is the nature of reality?" (<i>Physics</i>), it is <i>Philosophy</i> actually that made scientists capable of discovery, and in broader sense makes the public curious, reasoning and wise. Understanding and practicing philosophy is what enables us to search, create and refine ideas.

        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Thales of Miletus (around 624-548 BC)</a> was first to break from his civilization's explanation of objects and events as being due to the whims of gods. He instead offered naturalistic theories and hypotheses. Legend has it that while others prayed to gods for good harvest, Thales, by deducing that weather conditions, not appeals to the gods, led to a good harvest, achieved riches by buying up all the local olive presses just before high yield and renting them out in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras">Protagoras (490-420 BC)</a> was openly sophist, amassing considerable riches and fame by offering himself as an advisor (for people pleading their case in court) and teacher (claiming to teach euboulia i.e. excellence in counsel or sound judgement). His book titled Truth opened with the provocative sentence "Of all things the measure is man: of those that are, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are not", conveying to the effect that truth depends on perspective of the speaker, for one who calls an apple tasteless would be true in his own right as one who calls it tasty. A broader implication of this idea can be seen in Mathematics where the unit system tackles the broader notion that "everything is relative". In many matters therefore, reasoning would leads to construction of objectivity that one likens, due to the subjective nature of such matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to what Protagoras would have us believe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates (470-399 BC)</a> came up with a dialectical method where a less personal form of truth can result from a dialogue between parties which may hold opposing views, but hold common intention of learning. He wrote nothing and held no ideas as his own. The method earned him many enemies in Athens, where he lived, was vilified as a sophist (imagine that!) and was sentenced to death on charges of corrupting the young with ideas that undermined tradition. Today, his method is a cornerstone in Western philosophy. The Socratic method is a process of questioning, from a noob standpoint, the meaning of essential concepts that one uses every day but have never really thought about, thereby revealing our ignorance. His method of discovering the 'right', when applied in a discourse with an individual, also discovers what is 'wrong' with their beliefs. In his search for areté (virtue) he concluded that morality demands us to continuously 'examine' ourselves, for knowledge is the root of good, and ignorance that of evil. When Socrates said "the unexamined life is not worth living", he meant to not let any day pass without deep discussions with friends about goodness in all that happened and was done, rather than the accumulation of wealth and higher status. His proposition, I infer, is that we shall create personal identity not with consumer products, but with knowledge.

        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
          While Thales realized interaction of worldly processes as alternative causal explanations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagorus (570-495 BC)</a> realized mathematics as alternative language for universal forms and ideas. Whereas Egyptians had only discovered that a triangle whose sides have ratios of 3:4:5 always has a right angle (for its practical use), Pythagoras' 'revelation' that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides in all right-angled triangles had him held by Pythagoreans as a virtual messiah. He held his belief that the form of cosmos must be goverened by mathematical rules in addition (not in opposition) to the Milesian ideas on the substance of cosmos. In present day we easily accept geometry and atomism, two radically different perceptions of the content of the universe, without raising a finger. Pythagoras' ideas of harmonic relationships were uncanny, but they lead to the Law of Octaves in music and Chemistry. The principle of deductive reasoning can be traced to Pythagoras' perspective that 2 comes from 1+1. A mere expression of his fascination with numbers, which was later refined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid (around 300 BC)</a> forming basis of much of mathematical thinking. Pythagoras' idea that abstract thinking is superior to the evidence of the senses was a haughty proposition but has proved necessary to cause one to search for a higher ground to understand the world from. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides">Parmenides (around 500 BC)</a> deduced, in a Pythagorean way of abstract thinking, that something cannot come from nothing, a precursor to the modern law of conservation of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
          In theory of Forms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato (around 428-347 BC)</a> later refined Pythagoras' thesis about forms of cosmos, a pursuit in abstraction beyond sense-experience. According to Plato, reasoning is the process through which we can be able to perceive ideal forms (e.g. a circle) in the world of Ideas, of which everything we observe is an imperfect form (e.g. the sun) in the material (sensed) world. Employing abstraction, Plato argues that there exists an Idea of justice, which is true justice, and all the instances of justice in the material world around us are lesser variants of it. Through reasoning our goal should be to seek that ideal form. Plato believes this is possible by all of us: our body exists in the material world and able to perceive the forms in it through senses, while our mind can perceive ideal forms in it through reason. Plato imagines that our soul, which is immortal and eternal, must have inhabited the world of Ideas before our birth and yearns to return to that realm after our death. Learning then is only recollection of memories of the ideal forms, long familiar to our soul. Plato founded a school named Academy (from which "academic" is derived).
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          In contrast to what Plato has us believe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle (384–322 BC)</a>, a student of Plato at his Academy, proposed that ideal forms are generalized forms learnt from observation of varied forms in the material world. Although he came up with this counter proposal from his wildlife studies, and did not, in a clear way, refute Plato's proposition, it led to the division of epistemology camp into rationalists (knowledge from within) and empiricists (knowledge from outside). To prove his point, Aristotle set out to collect specimens of flora and fauna, and devised a hierarchical system so elegant in construction that it still forms the basis of modern taxonomy. With demonstration of human-level classification in computer vision, it becomes apparent that ideal forms may indeed be learnt from observation; still it doesn't disprove Plato's proposition. Aristotle, realizing observation as the source of truth about an object, came up with a causal system of an object's characteristics: material cause (what is it made of?), formal cause (how is it arranged?), efficient cause (how was it brought into being?), and final cause (what is its purpose?). It is easy to see that they are segregation of <i>Chemistry</i>, <i>Physics</i>, <i>Biology</i>, and Teleology (branch of <i>Philosophy</i>) for systematic study. Aristotle also came up with syllogism, the first formal system of logic ever devised. With Organon, Aristotle's notes on logic became the standard text on logic and remained so until the emergence of mathematical logic as late as in the 19th century.

        <h2>Harmony</h2>
        <p>
          With Daode jing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Laozi (around 600-300 BC)</a> layed down a path for morality and ethics in Eastern Philosophy. He explained that the changes of the world are expression of dao (the Way) which lead to thousands of manifestations that make the world such as sunrise, aging, frustration, rain, etc. It is because of our desire and free will, we can stray from the dao, and disturb the world’s harmonious balance. By living in harmony with dao, we may lead a life of de (virtue). What dao is can't be expressed. But dao can be achieved through wu wei (non-reaction). It is the act of thoughtfulness, harmonious existence, simplicity, and solitary meditation that can champion one over the impulsivity, desires, ambition and overexploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Siddhartha Gautama (563-483 BC)</a> found that emotional suffering came from attachment to the self. He believed that a "middle way", between fun (self-indulgence) and disciple (self-denial), leads one to true happiness which he could not reach with sole practice of either.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius (551-479 BC)</a> proposed that the de (virtue) in relationships are that of benevolence (ren; encompassing seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness) and loyality (encompassing zhong, xiao, and li). For example, father should be loving while the child obedient, husband/wife should be fair and the wife/husband understanding, elder sibling should be gentle and the younger sibling respectful. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi">Mozi (470-391 BC)</a>, disliking the superior-inferior model of relationships, made a counter proposal that relationships should be equalized by reprocity and it can be achieved by belief of jian ai (universal love).
